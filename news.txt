According to a 2013 report from the American Association for the Advancement of Science, $115 billion is spent annually in the United States on life science research. Fifty percent of this total is spent on preclinical research, half of which—$28 billion—is not reproducible.

Bioethics and the reproducibility crisis

According to the mayor of Chicago, Rahm Emanuel, who is linked to bioethics through his bioethicist brother Ezekiel Emanuel, "You never let a serious crisis go to waste.” In this case the crisis is the reproducibility of published results in the biological and medical sciences. According to a recent comment in Nature, “An unpublished 2015 survey by the American Society for Cell Biology found that more than two-thirds of respondents had on at least one occasion been unable to reproduce published results. Biomedical researchers from drug companies have reported that one-quarter or fewer of high-profile papers are reproducible.”


Improving the reproducibility of biomedical research

The Academy of Medical Sciences has published a new joint report on how the reproducibility and reliability of research can be improved. Recent reports in the general and scientific media show there is increasing concern within the biomedical research community about the lack of reproducibility of key research findings.


Reproducibility in science — where the MRC comes in

The MRC and a group of partner organisations have today published a report and joint statement  about the reproducibility and reliability of research, and what can be done to improve them. Here, Jim Smith, MRC Deputy Chief Executive and Director of Strategy, thinks about how discussions of reproducibility offer us the opportunity to improve the way science is done.


NEW STUDY: SCIENTIFIC RESEARCHES ARE NOT ALWAYS RELIABLE

Researchers tested the credibility of past investigations reaching the conclusion of a new study: scientific researches are not always reliable. Few of the past studies could be replicated showing that some researches are either too biased or too distinctive to make a statement in history.


The Results of the Reproducibility Project Are In. They’re Not Good.

A decade ago, John P.A. Ioannidis published a provocative and much-discussed paper arguing that most published research findings are false. It’s starting to look like he was right.


MASSIVE STUDY REPORTS CHALLENGES IN REPRODUCING PUBLISHED PSYCHOLOGY FINDINGS

A study that sought to replicate 100 findings published in three prominent psychology journals has found that, across multiple criteria, independent researchers could replicate less than half of the original findings. In some cases this may call into question the validity of some scientific findings, but it may also point to the difficulty of conducting effective replications and achieving reproducible results.


Reproducibility blues

Research findings advance science only if they are significant, reliable and reproducible. Scientists and journals must publish robust data in a way that renders it optimally reproducible. Reproducibility has to be incentivized and supported by the research infrastructure but without dampening innovation.
